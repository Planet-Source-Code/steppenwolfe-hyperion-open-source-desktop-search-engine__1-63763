Installation:
Best to compile the dll first, but if you want to see how it works, projects are linked together
Problems:
There are two type libraries linked to the project, the wmi scripting object (wbemdisp.tlb), and runnable.tlb.
I have included both with the project, win98 users may not have wmi, if you get an error, either remove the reference, or link to the tlb in the 
Engine\Type Lib\ folder.
Bugs: 
I'm sure there are some.. (big project). If you find something, drop me an email at steppenwolfe_2000@yahoo.com, and try and be specific..
Anyhow, hope you like it, (and remember to vote!)
